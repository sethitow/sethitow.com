In Eminem's new album _Music to Be Murdered By_, a phrase returns that has made an appearence in several of Eminem's works throughout his career. 


## 2000 -- [Eminem -- The Real Slim Shady](https://genius.com/241200)
> Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose <br>
> But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms

## 2002 --  [Eminem feat. 50 Cent and Obie Trice -- Love Me](https://genius.com/Eminem-love-me-lyrics)
> I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal <br>
> It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it

## 2004 -- [D12 -- American Psycho II](https://genius.com/57873)
> I probably got a screw loose or two <br>
> Or maybe three or four of 'em

## 2020 -- [Eminem -- Never Love Again](https://genius.com/Eminem-never-love-again-lyrics)
> So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew <br>
> But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you


So far, I've found four uses of this phrase (which is fewer than I seem to recall). The phrase is always used in the same context, refering to himself.
