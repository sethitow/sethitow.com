## Unboxing to Hello World

The supremely unhelpful error of 
```
InitTarget() start
InitTarget() end
TotalIRLen = ?, IRPrint = 0x..000000000000000000000000
Cannot connect to target.
```

It took me an embarisingly long time to realize I had the SWD Clock and Data lines backwards ðŸ˜³

With that resolved, the J-Link connected without issue.

I tried to dump the flash but as reported by others, readback was locked. The only way forward was to erase the default applicaiton. 

```
nrfjprog --recover -f nrf52
```
