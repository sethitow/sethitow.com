## What is an Ohm per Square?
When measuring the resistance of thin materials, such as the wall of a container, it’s common to see the measurement recorded in Ohms-per-Square. No, this isn’t a mistake. Ohms-per-Square is the number of ohms from one side to another across an imaginary square of the material. Because we assume the material is very thin, the size of the square is irrelevant.  

In order for this assumption to be valid, the thickness of the material must be less that 40% of the side length of the square. In order for a proper measurement to be taken, the distance from the edge of the film to the square must be 4 times larger than the side length of the square.
