One of my favorite things to do while paragliding at the coast is to take photos of beautiful surroundings and fellow pilots. Photography makes long coastal flights a little more interesting and allows me to share my passion with friends and family. I've found that most great paragliding photos share these three characteristics.

## Number 1: A Paraglider
This might go without saying, but in order to take a paragliding photo, there needs to be a paraglider in the frame. Brightly colored wings often show up better in photographs. If the wing isn’t brightly colored, it should contrast sharply with the background. Wings that are blue/white are the hardest to photograph effectively. The pilot or harness should also clearly contrast against the background, to avoid the "floating bean" effect where a wing appears without a pilot. 

## Number 2. Framed against the sky
Paraglider are naturally in the sky, and that’s where they look the best.

In order to see the glider clearly, it’s beneficial to have the wing contract sharply against the blue of the sky.

Another option that can produce an interesting composition is to frame the glider against an ocean, sand dune, or other low-texture background. 

## Number 3: Interesting terrain in the frame
While capturing a paraglider against a clean blue background, this alone is not enough to capture the interest of a viewer.  Even when the glider is the only subject of the photo, a viewer needs a terrestrial reference to feel the sense of height and orientation. 

Oceans, mountains, trees, buildings all make excellent background . It’s possible to achieve a good composition with only clouds, however these are harder to capture and give less of a reference than
